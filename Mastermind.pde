/*
* ABOUT: Mastermind is a code-breaking game in which one player chooses a code, and the other player
* tries to guess it. In this assignment, we’ll be creating a Mastermind game with the computer
* choosing the code. As the human player makes guesses, the computer will give feedback as to
* how close those guesses are. If you’re interested in learning more:
