# Mastermind

Mastermind is a code-breaking game in which one player chooses a code, and the other player
tries to guess it. We’ll be creating a Mastermind game with the computer
choosing the code. As the human player makes guesses, the computer will give feedback as to
how close those guesses are. If you’re interested in learning more:

To run the programming you need to have processing installed in your computer. Run Mastermind.pde in 
your computer. 

The computer auto generates a secret code. To make a guess for the code choose a color by selecting
it from the mouse. If you have made a correct guess you will win else you will be given a hint on how many numbers you have guessed properly. If you have "O" it means you have a correct number in the correct position and if you have a "X" you have a correct number in the wrong position. If you recieved "---" then you have no correct number. If you have filled the entire grid with wrong guesses you lose.
